  name                = "my-vnet"
  location            = azurerm_resource_group.rg.location
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
}
 
resource "azurerm_subnet" "subnet" {
  name                 = "my-subnet"
  resource_group_name  = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  virtual_network_name = azurerm_virtual_network.vnet.name

Reduced errors by automating AKS deployments with Terraform modules and parameter files.
Overall explanation
Terraform modules for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) help maintain consistent configurations across environments:

  cluster_name        = "prod-cluster"
  node_count         = 3
  vm_size             = "Standard_D2_v2"
}
This approach reduces manual errors and improves scalability.

86. How have you implemented Terraform for disaster recovery in Azure?
Used Terraform for disaster recovery by replicating resources in another region using templates.

Terraform can replicate infrastructure in another region for disaster recovery:

resource "azurerm_storage_account" "dr" {
  name                     = "mystorageaccountdr"
  location                 = "westus"
  resource_group_name      = azurerm_resource_group.rg.name
  account_replication_type = "GRS" # Geo-redundant storage
}
This ensures failover readiness.

  vnet_name  = "my-vnet"
  location   = "eastus"
  subnet_ids = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24"]
}
Modules improve code reusability and reduce duplication.

88. ******How do you ensure that sensitive data (like passwords and keys) is not exposed in Terraform configurations?

Use Azure Key Vault for secret management in Terraform:

resource "azurerm_key_vault_secret" "example" {
  name         = "db-password"
  value        = "supersecret"
  key_vault_id = azurerm_key_vault.example.id
}
This ensures secrets are securely managed.

89. What are Sentinel policies in Terraform, and how do they help in securing infrastructure?
Sentinel policies are Terraform security tools that enforce compliance by validating Terraform plans against security rules.

Overall explanation
A Sentinel policy can restrict deployments to approved regions:

import "tfplan/v2" as tfplan
 
main = rule {
  all tfplan.resource_changes as r {
    r.change.after.location in ["eastus", "westus"]
  }
}
This ensures governance and compliance.

90. How do you audit changes made to infrastructure through Terraform?

Terraform Cloud records logs for every apply, allowing you to track changes in state files and VCS history.

91. How do you restrict users from directly modifying Azure resources managed by Terraform?
Restrict direct changes by enforcing Terraform workflows and locking critical resources.

Overall explanation
Use RBAC and policy enforcement to restrict modifications:

Assign least privilege IAM roles to Terraform users.

Enable state locking to prevent direct resource modifications.


92. How do you integrate Terraform with Azure Policy for governance?
Integrate Terraform with Azure Policy by deploying policy definitions using templates.


Overall explanation
Deploy an Azure Policy with Terraform to enforce tagging standards:

resource "azurerm_policy_definition" "example" {
  name         = "require-tags"
  policy_type  = "Custom"
  display_name = "Require Resource Tags"
 
  policy_rule = <<POLICY
{
  "if": {
    "field": "tags",
    "equals": ""
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
POLICY
}
This ensures all Azure resources comply with governance policies.
